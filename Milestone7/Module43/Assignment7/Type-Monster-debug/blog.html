        <h3>Differences between Local storage and Session storage?</h3>
        <div>
          <p class="space">
            <span class="bold">LocalStorage: </span>This read-only interface
            property provides access to the Document's local storage object, the
            stored data is stored across browser sessions. If we set any data in
            localStorage it will be stored there unless we delete it. If we
            close tab, even close the browser localStorage data always stored.
            In short, localStorage sets data permanently.
          </p>
          <p class="space">
            <span class="bold">SessionStorage: </span>Session Storage objects
            can be accessed using the sessionStorage read-only property. The
            difference between sessionStorage and localStorage is that
            localStorage data does not expire, whereas sessionStorage data is
            cleared when the page session ends. In short, sessionStorage sets
            data temporarily.

        <h3>Differences between Global scope and local scope variable?</h3>
        <div>

            <span class="bold">Global scope: </span> Global scope contains all
            of the things defined outside of all code blocks. A code block
            simply consists of grouped statements inside curly braces ({ }). if
            statement, loops, function are examples of structure that create a
            code block. A global variable has global scope. A global variable is
            accessible from anywhere in the code.

        <h3>How eventLoop works in JavaScript?</h3>
        <div>
          <p class="space">JavaScript is single threaded but can works asynchronously because of the event loop. The event loop is a process that waits for the Call Stack to be clear before pushing callbacks from the Task Queue to the Call Stack. Once the Stack is clear, the event loop triggers and checks the Task Queue for available callbacks. If there are any, it pushes it to the Call Stack, waits for the Call Stack to be clear again, and repeats the same process. </p>

          <li>variable that is not initialized will give undefined.</li>

          <li>if return has nothing on the right side will return undefined.</li>
          <li> property that doesn't exists on an object will give you undefined.</li>
          <li> accessing array elements outside of the index range</li>
          <li>deleting an element inside an array</li>
